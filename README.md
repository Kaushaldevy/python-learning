# This is a short note on the Python Testing
In Python, the following are some data types.
* String - "hello"
* int - days = 20
* float - price = 9.99
* True - valid_number = True
* False - exit_input = False 
* List - Represent it as ["Apple", "Oranges", "Grapes", "Kiwi"]
you can access any of them with the index [2] -> Grapes. The index starts with 0.
You can append to it. Eg. list1.append("banana").
#list of having both integers and strings
c= ["hey","you",1,2,3,"go"]

* Set - Represent with {10,20,30,50}
In sets, there are no duplicate values. It also does not have a sense of the index as well. 
You can add or remove

* Dictionary - Has key, and value pairs. It's represented similar to a set with {}
Eg: {"days": 20, "unit": "hours" }.
To access a value you use the key with [] or can use the get() method.
Eg: your_dict["days"] or your_dict.get("days")
calculation_to_units = {"hours": 24, "days": 1}
name_of_unit = {"hours": "hours", "days": "days"}

* Tuple
This is immutable and is a sequence similar to a list.
Eg: (1,2,3,4)
#tuple having multiple types of data.
b=("hello", 1,2,3,"go")
tuple.count(2) -> This will print the number of occurrences of 2.

In VSCode we can move multiple lines with Ctrl+[ or Ctrl+] buttons. Also, can use Shift+TAB to move left
To run a file can use shift+Enter
Can comment multiple lines with Ctrl + /

-------------------
* Module is a 1 python file, while package could be a collection of python files. A library is a collection of packages.
* In Python, self is a reference to the current instance of the class.
* Class name starts with capital and python file related to the class starts with simple letter.
* Functions within a class are called methods like in Java.
